# MoodRot
MoodRot is a completely unnecessary yet strangely fascinating experiment in AI-powered mood detection and cursor manipulation. Using DeepFace and MediaPipe, it scans your face, figures out your mood (probably incorrectly), and then randomly messes with your cursorâ€™s sensitivity based on how you're feeling.
